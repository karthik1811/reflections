What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It allows git to track revisions. We need to do this else Git wont know that 
it has to track changes to this directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

staging area contains the files that are to be committed, whereas working directory 
contains all the files. This helps us choose selective files to commit rather 
than commit the entire directory.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

I can move only those files that I really want to commit to the staging area.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

To try out experimental changes which are not sure to go out. It helps us to 
easily switch between our version and the original version.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

They help us understand the various branches present and find out any 
unreachable commits

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

All the changes get merged together in the same branch. The diagram helps us 
visualise the changes in the respective branches.

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

Pros: saves a lot of time
Cons: at times may result in inappropriate code getting merged or appropriate 
code getting lost
