What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It allows git to track revisions. We need to do this else Git wont know that 
it has to track changes to this directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

staging area contains the files that are to be committed, whereas working directory 
contains all the files. This helps us choose selective files to commit rather 
than commit the entire directory.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
