How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It pinpointed the lines that were changed hence preventing me from going through
the entire file

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

It would help keep track of my changes, and if something breaks I can easily 
find which change caused it.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

PROS: Flexibility, allows us to choose appropriate commit size
CONS: We might forget to commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git caters to code, and in most coding scenarios a particular change tends to 
affect more than one file. On the other hands docs in google docs tend not to be 
related to each other, hence they are saved separately.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log shows all changes/commits made, and git diff shows the line differences 
between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

It makes me more confident bacause if I end up breaking something i can always
return back to the working version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

My AngularJS/Andriod project
